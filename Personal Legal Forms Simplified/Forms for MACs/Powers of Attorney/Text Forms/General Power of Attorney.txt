General Power of Attorney

Notice: This is an important document. Before signing this document, you should know these
important facts. By signing this document, you are not giving up any powers or rights to control
your finances and property yourself. In addition to your own powers and rights, you may be
giving another person, your attorney-in-fact, broad powers to handle your finances and property.
This general power of attorney may give the person whom you designate (your "attorney-in-
fact") broad powers to handle your finances and property, which may include powers to
encumber, sell or otherwise dispose of any real or personal property without advance notice to
you or approval by you. THE POWERS GRANTED WILL NOT EXIST AFTER YOU
BECOME DISABLED, OR INCAPACITATED. This document does not authorize anyone to
make medical or other health care decisions for you. If you own complex or special assets such
as a business, or if there is anything about this form that you do not understand, you should ask a
lawyer to explain this form to you before you sign it. If you wish to change your general power of
attorney, you must complete a new document and revoke this one. You may revoke this
document at any time by destroying it, by directing another person to destroy it in your presence
or by signing a written and dated statement expressing your intent to revoke this document. If
you revoke this document, you should notify your attorney-in-fact and any other person to whom
you have given a copy of the form. You also should notify all parties having custody of your
assets. These parties have no responsibility to you unless you actually notify them of the
revocation. If your attorney-in-fact is your spouse and your marriage is annulled, or you are
divorced after signing this document, this document is invalid. Since some 3rd parties or some
transactions may not permit use of this document, it is advisable to check in advance, if possible,
for any special requirements that may be imposed. You should sign this form only if the attorney-
in-fact you name is reliable, trustworthy and competent to manage your affairs. This form must
be signed by the Principal (the person appointing the attorney-in-fact), witnessed by two persons
other than the notary public, and acknowledged by a notary public.
