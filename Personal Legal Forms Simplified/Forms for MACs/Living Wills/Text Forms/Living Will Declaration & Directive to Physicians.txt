I,* ,being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desire that my life not be
artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth below, and, pursuant to any and all
applicable laws in the State of *, I declare that:

If at any time I should have an incurable injury, disease, or illness which has been certified as
a terminal condition by my attending physician and one additional physician, both of whom
have personally examined me, and such physicians have determined that there can be no
recovery from such condition and my death is imminent, and where the application of life
prolonging procedures would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, then:

I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally
with only the administration of medication, the administration of nutrition and/or hydration,
or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort,
care, or to alleviate pain.

If at any time I should have been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state which
has been certified as incurable by my attending physician and one additional physician, both
of whom have personally examined me, and such physicians have determined that there can
be no recovery from such condition, and where the application of life prolonging procedures
would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, then:

I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally
with only the administration of medication, the administration of nutrition and/or hydration,
or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort,
care, or to alleviate pain.

In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding my treatment in the above situations,
including directions regarding the use of such life prolonging procedures, then:
It is my intention that this declaration shall be honored by my family, my physician, and any
court of law, as the final expression of my legal right to refuse medical and surgical treatment.
I declare that I fully accept the consequences for such refusal.

If I have any additional directions, I will state them here:


If I have also signed a Health Care Power of Attorney, Appointment of Health Care Agent, or
Health Care Proxy, I direct the person who I have appointed with such instrument to follow
the directions that I have made in this document. I intend for my agent to be treated as I would
be with respect to my rights regarding the use and disclosure of my individually identifiable
health information or other medical records. This release authority applies to any information
governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (aka HIPAA),
42 USC 1320d and 45 CFR 160-164.

If I am diagnosed as pregnant, this document shall have no force and effect during my pregnancy.
I understand the full importance of this declaration, and I am emotionally and mentally
competent to make this declaration and Living Will. I also understand that I may revoke this
document at any time.
