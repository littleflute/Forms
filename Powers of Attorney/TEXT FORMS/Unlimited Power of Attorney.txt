Unlimited Power of Attorney

Notice: This is an important document. Before signing this document, you should know these
important facts. By signing this document, you are not giving up any powers or rights to control
your finances and property yourself. In addition to your own powers and rights, you are giving
another person, your attorney-in-fact, broad powers to handle your finances and property. This
unlimited power of attorney will give the person whom you designate (your "attorney-in-fact")
broad powers to handle your finances and property, which  includes powers to encumber, sell or
otherwise dispose of any real or personal property without advance notice to you or approval by
you. THE POWERS GRANTED WILL NOT EXIST AFTER YOU BECOME DISABLED, OR
INCAPACITATED. This document does not authorize anyone to make medical or other health
care decisions for you. If you own complex or special assets such as a business, or if there is
anything about this form that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain this form
to you before you sign it. If you wish to change your unlimited power of attorney, you must
complete a new document and revoke this one. You may revoke this document at any time by
destroying it, by directing another person to destroy it in your presence or by signing a written
and dated statement expressing your intent to revoke this document. If you revoke this document,
you should notify your attorney-in-fact and any other person to whom you have given a copy of
the form. You also should notify all parties having custody of your assets. These parties have no
responsibility to you unless you actually notify them of the revocation. If your attorney-in-fact is
your spouse and your marriage is annulled, or you are divorced after signing this document, this
document is invalid. Since some 3rd parties or some transactions may not permit use of this
document, it is advisable to check in advance, if possible, for any special requirements that may
be imposed. You should sign this form only if the attorney-in-fact you name is reliable,
trustworthy and competent to manage your affairs. This form must be signed by the Principal (the
person appointing the attorney-in-fact), witnessed by two persons other than the notary public,
and acknowledged by a notary public.
