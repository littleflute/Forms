These files are in the &quot;<b>FORMS_RTF</b>&quot; directory.</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Forms on this CD-ROM are set in the &ldquo;Times New Roman&rdquo; font and use type sizes ranging from 8-point to 12-point size.<br><br>To edit the forms using Microsoft Word, opening the file to be changed, use the &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; command to place a copy of the form on your hard drive. Position the cursor in the area you wish to amend, taking note of the font size and paragraph formatting of the surrounding text before you make any changes. If your deletions, additions, or replacements of text alter the layout in an unsatisfactory manner, simply select the edited lines and reformat them to suit your preference.<br><br>To fill out the forms in a word-processing program, follow the directions above to open the appropriate file. Use either the &ldquo;click and drag&rdquo; method with your mouse or the SHIFT and arrow keys on your keyboard to select underlined blanks with the cursor. Then type your answers. To emphasize your answers, select the underline setting from the font options. Exceptions to this method are found in Form_36, Form_38, Form_39, and Form_40. These files contain tables that have been devised to preserve the more complex formatting of the forms. Simply type your answers in the appropriate cells, making any necessary changes by selecting the text to be edited and replacing it with your own wording.<br><br>All the forms have also been saved as PDF files in the &ldquo;<b>FORMS_PDF</b>&rdquo; directory. This file format can be read using the Adobe Acrobat Reader software. Using the Reader, the forms will appear exactly as they are in the book. They can be printed out and used as is, or they can be customized by copying and pasting text into ANY word-processing or page-layout program. To do this, first open the PDF Form file you want to copy. Click the&nbsp; &ldquo;T&rdquo; button in the Tool Bar at the top of the screen, select the text you want to use, go to the Edit menu and choose copy. Then switch to your word-processing or page-layout program to paste in the text. Although this method captures the content of the forms, it will eliminate the formatting; it is therefore only recommended if you are using earlier versions of MS Word or WordPerfect or are unable to import the files supplied on this disk into a word-processing program of your choice.<br><br>The only form that has not been included in word-processing format is Form 29 the TX form for copyright registration. It has been saved as &ldquo;Form_29.pdf&rdquo; in the &ldquo;<b>FORM_PDF</b>&rdquo; directory. This form should not be modified; it is only intended for printing and filling out.<br><br>For the latest information on Allworth Press books visit our Web site at <a href="http://http://www.allworth.com">www.allworth.com</a></font></p><p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">====================================================================================<br><i>Adobe, Acrobat, are trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated.
